### Project 10: Full Stack App with React and a REST API
Author - Hans Steffens: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanscode/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>

## Project Overview
This project is about a full stack web application that provides an intuitive way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

Developed using React, this client interface uses a fictional school database connecting to a REST API I created in a previous project: <a href="https://github.com/hanscode/rest-api-sql-v3" target="_blank">REST API using Express</a>

> <b>Additional note for macOS Monterey (or higher) users:</b> <br />
> Apple introduced some changes with AirPlay when they launched macOS Monterey. Now, the AirPlay Receiver uses ports 5000 and 7000. You will need to follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/mac-help/mchl15c9e4b5/mac" target="_blank">these instructions</a> to turn off the AirPlay receiver, to be able to use port 5000 with this project.
