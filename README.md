### Project 10: Full Stack App with React and a REST API
Author - Hans Steffens

## Project Overview
This project is about a full stack web application that provides an intuitive way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

Developed using React, this client interface uses a fictional school database connecting to a REST API I created in a previous project: <a href="https://github.com/hanscode/rest-api-sql-v3" target="_blank">REST API using Express</a>
